# Docker Official Installers

This project is to create the "official" installers that will be used to create the various Docker releases.  These include EC2, Qemu (Mac/Windows), virtual disk for Virtualbox/VMware and eventually other providers such as Digital Ocean, Google Compute, etc.

# Preface
Initial requirements:

* Use docker to build
* Pre-bake images (no launch instance & build)
